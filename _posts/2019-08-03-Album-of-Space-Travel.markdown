Konstantin Tsiolkovsky was a Russian and Soviet rocket scientist and pioneer of the astronautic theory. Along with the Robert Esnault-Pelterie, Hermann Oberth and Robert Goddard, he is considered to be one of the founding fathers of modern rocketry and astronautics. His works later inspired leading Soviet rocket engineers such as Sergei Korolev and Valentin Glushko and contributed to the success of the Soviet space program. He wrote more than 400 works including approximately 90 published pieces on space travel and related subjects. Among his works are designs for rockets with steering thrusters, multistage boosters, space stations, airlocks for exiting a spaceship into the vacuum of space, and closed-cycle biological systems to provide food and oxygen for space colonies.

The Album of Space Travel, published in 1932, shows Tsiolkovsky's visionary ideas about life in space, including discussions of zero gravity, air pressure locking, space habitats, and rocket guidance. I have curated some of Tsiolkovsky's original work depicting his visionary ideas about space travel, [archived](http://www.ras.ru/ktsiolkovskyarchive/1_actview.aspx?id=84) by the Russian Academy of Sciences, which you can find in the gallery below.
