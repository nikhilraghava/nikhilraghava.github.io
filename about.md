Hi! I'm Nikhil Raghavendra, an engineering student with extensive full stack development experience working with electronics, machine learning, and cloud computing. I have a strong passion for creating useful products that make people's lives better with a focus on aesthetics and creative design. I'm a serial-hackathon attendee, and I've won several prizes from Bosch, Amazon Web Services and Airbus Defence and Space.

I've also been conferred with the Tan Kah Kee Young Inventors' Award for my invention titled: "Disaster Recovery with HOPE handset and COMPASS dashboard" along with fellow inventors James and Bryan (who also happen to be part of my hackathon team).

I'm an autodidact who likes to learn about computing, electronics, space, and design during my free time. I use this personal website to collect and organize my thoughts and learning experiences into blog posts and tutorials. If you like my posts, kindly share it with people interested in these topics. Hope you find the content in my blog useful ðŸ˜‰.
